## What is FOSSIL?

FOSSIL is a pure Fortran (KISS) library for IO and manipulation of STL (Stereo Litography) files for modern (2003+) Fortran projects.

FOSSIL provides a simple API to IO STL files and also to manipulate the triangulated surface contained into the STL file.

![dragon](pre_docs/dragon.jpg)

> the dragon STL test (src/tests/dragon.stl) is composed by 6588 triangular facets. The signed distance computation on a uniform
> grid of `64^3` is accelerated by a factor of 7x using AABB algorithm with respect the simple brute force.

> automatic repair of disconnected edges.

### A Taste of FOSSIL

FOSSIL is an KISS library:

#### simple load
> effortless load of file (with STL surface analysis)
```fortran
use fossil
type(file_stl_object)    :: file_stl    ! STL file handler.
type(surface_stl_object) :: surface_stl ! STL surface handler.

call file_stl%initialize(file_name='cube.stl')
call file_stl%load_from_file(surface=surface_stl, guess_format=.true.)
```

#### print STL statistics
> print main informations of STL
```fortran
print '(A)', file_stl%statistics()
print '(A)', surface_stl%statistics()
```
> upon exection will print something like
```bash
Mesh_1
file name:   src/tests/cube.stl
file format: ascii
X extents: [ 0.000000000000000E+000, +0.100000000000000E+001]
Y extents: [ 0.000000000000000E+000, +0.100000000000000E+001]
Z extents: [ 0.000000000000000E+000, +0.100000000000000E+001]
volume: -0.100000000000000E+001
centroid: [+0.500000000000000E+000, +0.500000000000000E+000, +0.500000000000000E+000]
number of facets: +12
number of facets with 1 edges disconnected: +0
number of facets with 2 edges disconnected: +0
number of facets with 3 edges disconnected: +0
number of AABB refinement levels: +2
```

#### sanitiza normals
> make normals consistent
```fortran
call surface_stl%sanitize_normals
```

#### simple manipulations
> simply manipulate geometry
```fortran
call surface_stl%resize(factor=3.4*ex + 2*ey + 0.5*ez) ! ex, ey, ez being axis versors
call surface_stl%resize(x=0.5, z=1.2)                  ! scale only x and z axis
call surface_stl%mirror(normal=ex)                     ! mirror respect yz-plane
call surface_stl%mirror(normal=ex+ey)                  ! mirror respect plane with normal ex+ey
call surface_stl%mirror(matrix=matrix)                 ! mirror by a given mirroring matrix
call surface_stl%rotate(axis=ex, angle=1.57)           ! rotate around x axis by pi/2
call surface_stl%rotate(matrix=matrix)                 ! rotati by a given rotating matrix
call surface_stl%translate(delta=3*ex + 2*ey + 0.5*ez) ! translate by a vectorial delta
call surface_stl%translate(x=0.5, z=1.2)               ! translate by only x and z delta
```
